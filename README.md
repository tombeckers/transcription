Converting audio fragments into written language.

A simple Python program that takes an audio file as input and gives a text file as output. It cuts the audio file in segments of about 30 seconds and pastes them in the text file. It cannot handle audio files longer than 60 minutes, and only works with wav files. The standard language is English, but this can be adjusted within the file.
